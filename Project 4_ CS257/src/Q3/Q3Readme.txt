Overview:
This program implements and tests generic sorting algorithms in Java for a given file.
The program reads in a file containing an array of strings, sorts the array using two different sorting algorithms,
and prints the sorted arrays to the console.
The sorting algorithms implemented are Insertion Sort and Selection Sort.

Instructions:
Assuming that JDK is installed on your machine, follow the steps below to run the program:
Compile the java files by running the command: javac Q3/*.java
Run the test program by running the command: java Q3.SortTest <filename>
where <filename> is the name of the file containing the elements to be sorted.

Results:
The program successfully sorts an array of strings using both the Insertion Sort and Selection Sort algorithms.

Known Bugs:
There are no known bugs at this time.
