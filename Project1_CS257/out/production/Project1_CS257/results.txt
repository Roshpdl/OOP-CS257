To test the methods on ArrayUtils.java class, following set of arrays are used:

int[] array1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 35, 20, 15, 12, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23};
int[] array2 = new int[4];
array2[0] = 5;
array2[1] = 10;
array2[2] = 15;

To test the methods on ArrayListUtils.java class, following ArrayList is used:

ArrayList<Integer> array = new ArrayList<>();
array.add(3);
array.add(6);
array.add(9);
array.add(12);
